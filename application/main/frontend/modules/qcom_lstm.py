    current closing price \( t \).
    
    **Trading Strategy Implementation:** Once the model is ready and optimized, it will be used to make trading decisions:
    - **Long Order:** Place a long order if the model predicts that the next closing price will be higher than the current 
    closing price.
    - **Short Order:** Close the long order and place a short order if the model predicts that the next closing price will 
    be lower.

**Building trend predictive model in a machine learning approach**

**1. Model Construction**
   - Start by selecting the model architecture, type, input data, and target.
   - Generate necessary data features and layout a blueprint for the predictive model.
   - The architecture of the model has been previously defined and described.

**2. Parameter Tuning**
   - Even with a chosen model blueprint, numerous internal parameters require tuning to tailor the model for specific tasks.
   - A Bayesian search was conducted in a parallel cloud environment to rapidly identify optimal settings.
   - For more detailed information, refer to the **Model Selection Report** at the end of this page or in 
   [this link](https://api.wandb.ai/links/qhuy0168/pxwhp4d5).

**3. Fine Tuning and Training**
   - After acquiring the optimal parameter set, the model undergoes additional fine-tuning and extended training to achieve maximum convergence.
   - The final model, along with the relevant data scaler, is available for download at artifact section of 
   [this link](https://wandb.ai/qhuy0168/fin_timeseries/runs/xpl0zpzp?nw=nwuserqhuy0168).

**4. Signal Tuning for Binary Classification**
   - As the task involves binary classification, further tuning can be accomplished by adjusting the decision threshold to refine decision-making.
   
**5. Backtesting and Production**
   - Adjusted thresholds are tested during the backtesting phase with recent data to validate the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
   - Following successful backtesting, the model is ready for production deployment.

    **Training and backtesting timeframe**
    According to random walk theory, consistently outperforming the market in the long run is viewed as nearly impossible. 
    Initial examination of long-term data supports this notion, revealing that while certain phenomena may recur in the 
    short term, they do not predictably extend into the long term. Additionally, preliminary analysis from a data science 
    perspective shows that the price data is **not stationary**, leading to a decline in predictive performance over time. 
    This also means that certain data manipulation techniques may become invalid. 
    
    Consequently, for strategies that span a medium timeframe, it is critical to select a training and validation period 
    that isn't too lengthy to avoid over-fitting. 
    
    Furthermore, to keep up with evolving market conditions, the model should be frequently retrained with fresh data to 
    ensure ongoing relevance and accuracy.
    
    Therefore, the duration for this experiment is chosen and listed below:

    The model focuses on predicting the closing prices of targeted assets for each timestep \( t \) and \( t+1 \), within a 30-minute interval. The probability signal, which indicates whether the price is likely to go up or down, is visualized in the third plot below:

- **Signal Interpretation:** If the signal value at timestep \( t \) is above 0.5 (or 50%), it suggests an upward trend in the closing value at \( t+1 \). This threshold is used to train the model to reliably predict positive movements in asset prices.

This approach allows the probabilistic outputs of the model to be effectively used as actionable trading signals.

However, as mentioned previously, the **random walk nature of the market** means that the data is not stationary. Consequently, the output signal from the model is not expected to clearly deliver **two distinct distributions for the classes (up or down)**.

As visualized above, the probability of an upward or downward trend tends to **fluctuate between 0.35 and 0.55**, rather than spanning the two ends of the target value spectrum (0 and 1). This behavior indicates that the model's probability outputs are clustered around the center of the range, that the signal reflecting certaintiness instead of decisive predictions.

Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the results and fine-tune the class discrimination threshold before deploying the model into production. This adjustment will help in better aligning the model's sensitivity to actual market movements and enhance its practical utility.

- The "Threshold vs. Accuracy" plot reveals that the model's accuracy peaks at thresholds of 0.4914 and 0.5097. 
- This phenomenon occurs because the probability distribution tends to cluster around the midpoint (0.5). Thus, slight 
adjustments around this central value significantly influence the model's performance.
- Deciding whether to increase or decrease the threshold depends on the strategic priority of the model: **whether 
increasing the number of positive predictions (indicating an upward trend) is more important than overall accuracy**.
- Consequently, final tuning of the model â€” **choosing the optimal threshold that yields the highest accuracy from the

- In the backtesting environment, the final returns from the algorithmic decisionsâ€”based solely on the signals generated 
by the LSTM modelâ€”were analyzed to identify the optimal threshold value.
- The returns of the algorithm were **compared against a benchmark 'buy and hold' strategy**, which serves as a simple 
yet effective measure of market performance over time.
- The results indicated that a **lower threshold (0.4914)**, which makes the model more sensitive to detecting downward 
trends, led to **superior outcomes** compared to other thresholds that prioritize upward trend detection, and the 
standard threshold of 0.5.
- This phenomenon can be explained by the overall upward trend observed during the testing period. In such a market, a 
strategy that **effectively utilizes quality signals on downward trends** allows the model to generate returns that 
surpass those of a standard buy and hold strategy. This is due to the model's enhanced ability to capitalize on brief but 
significant market downturns for potential gains.

  &rarr; As a result, for a strategy that relies solely on the LSTM-generated signals, the model output with a 
  **threshold of 0.4914** should be adopted as the key decision-making parameter. This threshold setting has been 
  identified as **optimal for maximizing returns** based on the model's predictive accuracy during backtesting.
